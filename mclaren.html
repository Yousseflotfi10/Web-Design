			The McLaren Group is a British company based in Woking, England, which is involved in Formula One and 
			other motorsport and the manufacture of luxury cars.
			The group was founded by Ron Dennis shortly after his acquisition of the McLaren Formula One team in 1981, 
			as the TAG McLaren Group due to a partnership with Mansour Ojjeh's TAG Group. 
			The Formula One team had been established by New Zealander Bruce McLaren in 1963.

				<p>
					The McLaren GT’s sweeping, sculpted profile isn’t simply our interpretation of what a Grand Tourer can be. 
					But what it should be. Driven by our ‘everything for a reason design philosophy. Fuelled by the spirit of innovation. 
					It starts at the core, with a bespoke MonoCell II-T carbon fibre chassis for maximum strength but minimum weight – perfect for touring with power, speed and efficiency. 
					Our iconic Dihedral doors are unique in the class, too. 
					While the car’s versatile, spacious and elegant form is a model of aerodynamic efficiency.
